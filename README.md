# Python Learning Platform

Python Learning Platform is a browser-based app for learning and practicing basic Python without any local setup. It offers simple coding tasks, an in-browser editor, a syntax cheat sheet, and progress tracking ‚Äî all presented in a straightforward interface.

The project was inspired by the study sessions with school students which we host at our University. The tasks are aimed at giving these students a user-friendly space to practice both during those lessons and at home, making it easier for them to start learning programming and not get intimidated by installing VSCode, Python or other tools.
